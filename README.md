This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VBScript caused by implicit type conversion. The script attempts to find the absolute value of a number. However, due to the implicit conversion of the function parameter to a string, the comparison '<' will perform lexicographical comparison instead of numerical comparison, leading to unexpected output. The solution provides a corrected function with explicit type handling to avoid this issue.
